Today, I'm announcing **[Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)**, the first product from [Rubinius, Inc](http://rubinius.com/2015/10/27/rubinius-inc-a-benefit-company/), building on the technology in the Rubinius language platform.

**[Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)** is a tool for anyone who has struggled to understand, evolve, transform, and scale an application.

It is an alternative to paying the significant cost to rewrite an application that has grown too large and complex to confidently update as quickly as business innovation now requires.

During the past 5-10 years, the world of programming has changed significantly. Languages like Clojure, Go, Rust, and Scala are commanding ever greater mind-share, and JavaScript has pushed into new territory, both within the browser and outside it. Programmers are not just switching languages, they are also changing the way they build applications.

At the same time, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and infrastructure automation are radically changing the way businesses deliver value to customers. These changes are also changing the way we build applications.

The next 5-10 years will make these past years seem tame. Tens of billions more devices are expected to be connected to the Internet in the next few years. The most important fact about all these devices is that they will be communicating with other devices. Distributed applications and microservices will be the default architecture. This evolution is already well underway.

Ruby has some challenges to continue to be useful in this changing environment. I'll post results soon from the recent surveys [Who's Using Ruby?](http://rubinius.com/2015/08/31/who-is-using-ruby-for-what-and-why/) and [What's your biggest pain point with Ruby?](https://goo.gl/forms/FRzpoIVHFL) Some companies have elected to meet these challenges by rewriting all or significant portions of their apps in different languages.

One major goal of **[Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)** is to preserve the investment in your existing apps while helping you focus on the most important areas to improve as business requirements change.

**[Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)** enters a well-established market where companies like [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com), [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/welcome/), [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com), and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) already exist. This represents both a challenge and a great opportunity.

I'm announcing **[Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)** now to invite you along on a collaborative and participatory journey to explore and tackle the biggest problems people have with existing apps, and build the tools that are essential for a new generation of apps, where developers must respond in seconds and minutes instead of days and weeks.

As **[Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)** is a tool that builds on Rubinius features, expanding adoption of Rubinius will be an ongoing focus. As mentioned in the [Rubinius, Inc announcement](http://rubinius.com/2015/10/27/rubinius-inc-a-benefit-company/), I'm excited to be able to work directly with customers to identify and solve problems they have with apps and processes.

Please take a few minutes to let us know which **[Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)** features would help you the most: <analyst@rubinius.com>.
