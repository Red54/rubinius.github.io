title: The Parisian Release

Rubinius 2.1.0 has been released. I'm naming this "The Parisian release" in
honor of the [dotRB conference](http://www.dotrb.eu/) in Paris and today being
Evan's birthday. I wanted this to be the 2.0 release, but circumstances, so
sorry about that.

Following the release scheme I detailed in the [2.0
release](http://rubini.us/2013/10/04/rubinius-2-0-released/), I've rev'd the
minor version because we added a few C-API functions and different standard
library loading stubs. The rest of the changes are basically bug fixes.

I'll be posting more soon about gems, packaging, and releases.

Enjoy! Preferably with a glass of nice wine but surely with something that
makes you happy.
