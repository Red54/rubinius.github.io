Today, I'm announcing **[Rubinius Compute](http://compute.rubinius.com)**, a platform for computation inspired by [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) that builds on the Rubinius language platform.

We see two major trends converging: First, more devices are being connected and those devices need to communicate, driving a constant rise in network use. Second, more data is being created, processed, and stored.

The problem is, there's a massive asymmetry in the network. A relatively tiny number of "smart" nodes do all the work and receive most of the communication, while an enormous number of nodes mostly just add load to the network.

The solution requires changing the way we build apps, moving towards distributed, resilient networks of collaborating nodes where computation and data co-exist.

[IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) is working on distributing content. We need to pair this with distributing computation. To do so, we need to move beyond the dominant abstraction of a "desktop computer", with operating system, libraries and packages, disk drives, etc. out in "the cloud".

**[Rubinius Compute](http://compute.rubinius.com)** is a foundation for building apps in a familiar way, leveraging **[Rubinius Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)** to understand and evolve them, and distributing them to the network without messing with irrelevant details from leaky "system" abstractions.

None of these ideas are new: distributed content, raw compute nodes without operating system abstractions, and apps as distributed networks of collaborating agents. But combined, they represent the most important shift yet seen in how we use computation.

Let's build the future.
