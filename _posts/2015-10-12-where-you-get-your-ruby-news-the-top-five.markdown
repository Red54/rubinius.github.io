title: "Where You Get Your Ruby News: The Top Five"

Recently, I was curious where people get news about Ruby these days. Lacking funds for a proper scientific poll, I sent a quick email to the Rubinius mailing list. A little more than two hundred people responded and I'm sharing some results below. Many thanks to everyone who took the time to respond!

(_Note that I'm not making any assertions regarding whether these results are representative, accurate, or useful. I found them interesting and thought you may, too._)

If you're familiar with Ruby, it may come as no surprise that Peter Cooper's mighty media empire and [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com) soundly takes first place. What surprised me is that Twitter scored so highly, above Hacker News and Reddit among the responders. Here is a graph of the top five sources cited by percentage of people (the percentages sum to greater than one hundred because many people listed more than one).

The other aspect I looked at was how many sources people listed. Again, it was a surprise to me that so many listed a single source. Granted, something like Ruby Weekly, Hacker News, or Twitter aggregates a lot of content, but it was still interesting. Also note that this was difficult to calculate because the response field was completely unformatted. I've made some assumptions in parsing it but I think the results are mostly accurate. Here's a graph of the number of sources people cited, by percentage.

Beginners and seasoned Ruby programmers alike need a constant stream of news and discussion to help them learn and grow as developers. It was sad to see one person answer with the following:

> At this point ruby feels dead I don't actively track it.

That was definitely the bleakest response, but a few people cited not being as involved with Ruby. There's a natural ebb and flow of interest, but if a few people are willing to say this, there's certainly a lot more that feel it. It's a reminder that sharing the interesting things we're doing with Ruby helps everyone, including people we don't even know.
