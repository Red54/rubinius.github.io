<h1>Rubinius Compute - Programming for the Internet</h1>

<p>Today, I'm announcing **[Rubinius Compute](http://compute.rubinius.com)**, a platform for computation inspired by [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) that builds on the Rubinius language platform.</p>

<div class="compute-cta">

<p>We see two major trends converging: First, more devices are being connected and those devices need to communicate, driving a constant rise in network use. Second, more data is being created, processed, and stored.</p>

<p>The problem is, there's a massive asymmetry in the network. A relatively tiny number of "smart" nodes do all the work and receive most of the communication, while an enormous number of nodes mostly just add load to the network.</p>

<h1>Who's Using Ruby (or Not), for What, and Why?</h1>

<p>The way we build, test, deploy, maintain, and support applications has changed a lot in the past five years. Containers, microservices, the growing number of connected devices (IoT, if you must), and the sorts of applications people are building with <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> are big, not small, changes.</p>

<p>How does Ruby and Rails fit into this rapidly changing landscape? If you search Google for <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=what%20companies%20use%20Ruby%20or%20Rails">"what companies use Ruby or Rails"</a> there's not a lot of specific details about <em>what</em> people are doing with Rails. How does Rails fit into a containerized microservices environment? How are people building services with Rails, or are they? I'm curious about this and I think a lot of the new developers learning Ruby in this changing environment would be as well.</p>

<p>So, I've put together a really brief survey; I'd love to hear more about why people are using Ruby, or why they are not.</p>

<p>Survey: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/cf8OstwXmI">Who's Using Ruby (or Not), for What, and Why?</a></p>

<h1>Rubinius Analyst - Know Your App</h1>

<p>Today, I'm announcing **[Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)**, the first product from [Rubinius, Inc](http://rubinius.com/2015/10/27/rubinius-inc-a-benefit-company/), building on the technology in the Rubinius language platform.</p>

<p>**[Analyst](http://analyst.rubinius.com)** is a tool for anyone who has struggled to understand, evolve, transform, and scale an application.</p>

<p>It is an alternative to paying the significant cost to rewrite an application that has grown too large and complex to confidently update as quickly as business innovation now requires.</p>

<p>During the past 5-10 years, the world of programming has changed significantly. Languages like Clojure, Go, Rust, and Scala are commanding ever greater mind-share, and JavaScript has pushed into new territory, both within the browser and outside it. Programmers are not just switching languages, they are also changing the way they build applications.</p>

<h1>Rubinius, Inc - A Benefit Company</h1>

<p>I'm excited to share with you that I've formed **Rubinius, Inc**, an Oregon corporation designated as a "benefit company", to focus on building excellent programming language tools and sustain the development of the Rubinius platform.</p>

<p>You may be wondering, [What is a benefit company?](http://benefitcorp.net)</p>

<p>Generally, it is a statutory designation that allows the business to consider the general social benefit and the environment when making decisions, rather than only focusing on revenue impact. The designation does not affect the tax structure for the business, and typically requires the business to publish an annual transparency report about the company's impact on society and the environment.</p>

<p>I elected to form a benefit company, rather than a foundation or non-profit, because I believe it provides the lowest administrative overhead while building a sustainable economic model to support Rubinius as an open source project. A portion of the shares of Rubinius, Inc are dedicated solely to sustaining Rubinius.</p>
