## Reporting Security Issues

We care deeply about providing a secure environment for running your code. If you find a security issue, please email <security@rubini.us>. Please encrypt your email using [our public key](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/blob/master/security.pub) (also available [on the our website](http://rubini.us/security.pub) or from the [MIT PGP database](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x0F7D2F9537F9880C)).

Our policy is to respond to you within 72 hours and we will work with you to create a fix for the issue. Sending an email to <security@rubini.us> will not result in a public disclosure. We will work with you on a public disclosure after we have a fix ready.

For security issues with the standard libraries that are copied from CRuby, please report them there directly to that project. The instructions can be found at [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/security/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/security/). We are notified as part of their reporting procedures and we ensure that Rubinius is patched in the cases when those vulnerabilities affect Rubinius as well.
