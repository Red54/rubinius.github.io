## Who's Using Ruby (or Not), for What, and Why?

The way we build, test, deploy, maintain, and support applications has changed a lot in the past five years. Containers, microservices, the growing number of connected devices (IoT, if you must), and the sorts of applications people are building with [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) are big, not small, changes.

How does Ruby and Rails fit into this rapidly changing landscape? If you search Google for ["what companies use Ruby or Rails"](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=what%20companies%20use%20Ruby%20or%20Rails) there's not a lot of specific details about _what_ people are doing with Rails. How does Rails fit into a containerized microservices environment? How are people building services with Rails, or are they? I'm curious about this and I think a lot of the new developers learning Ruby in this changing environment would be as well.

So, I've put together a really brief survey; I'd love to hear more about why people are using Ruby, or why they are not.
